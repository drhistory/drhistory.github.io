At **Dr. History X**, we encourage thoughtful discussions and debates about history. To keep our comment section respectful and engaging, we ask all participants to follow these guidelines:  

### **1. Stay on Topic**  
- Comments should be relevant to the article and the historical event discussed.  
- Off-topic discussions, spam, or self-promotion will be removed.  

### **2. Be Respectful**  
- Debate ideas, not individuals. Personal attacks, harassment, or hate speech will not be tolerated.  
- Disagreements are welcome, but they must remain civil and constructive.  

### **3. No Misinformation or Historical Denialism**  
- We welcome corrections to factual inaccuracies, but spreading deliberate misinformation, conspiracy theories, or historical denialism is prohibited.  
- If you believe an article contains an error, provide credible sources to support your claim.  

### **4. No Hate Speech or Discrimination**  
- Any comment containing racism, sexism, homophobia, antisemitism, or any other form of hate speech will be removed, and repeat offenders may be banned.  

### **5. No Trolling or Disruptive Behavior**  
- Do not post inflammatory, off-topic, or provocative comments solely to provoke reactions.  
- Intentional attempts to derail discussions or flood the comment section will result in moderation.  

### **6. Keep it Legal**  
- Do not post anything that violates copyright, encourages illegal activity, or discloses private information about others.  

### **7. Moderation and Enforcement**  
- Our team reserves the right to edit, delete, or restrict comments that violate these guidelines.  
- Repeat offenders may be banned from commenting.
