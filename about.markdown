Welcome to Dr. History X — a place where the past isn’t just a collection of old dates and names, but a vibrant tapestry of stories worth sharing. This website extends what you’ll find on my Twitter feed into something deeper: each tweet gets posted here and is often expanded into a richer story or article.

**What You’ll Find Here:**
- **Tweet Archives**: All my tweets, organized so you can easily revisit topics and discover threads you might have missed.
- **Long-Form Posts**: Whenever a short post sparks curiosity, I’ll dig deeper to provide more context and insights—because history always has layers.
- **Curiosities & Anecdotes**: From pivotal events to obscure anecdotes, I love spotlighting the hidden corners of history that can still teach us lessons today.

**Who Is Dr. History X?**  
I’m a lifelong student of history with a curiosity that stretches from ancient civilizations to modern cultural shifts. On Twitter, my goal is to spark conversations and inspire further reading. Here on the site, I aim to house those sparks in longer formats—collecting, refining, and expanding them for fellow explorers of the past.

**Why This Matters**  
In an age where information moves fast, it’s easy for interesting stories to get buried. By bringing each tweet here, I hope to provide a permanent, organized home for discussions on everything from lesser-known historical footnotes to major moments that shaped our world.

Thank you for stopping by and being part of this journey into history’s nooks and crannies. If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out—your curiosity fuels the explorations we embark on together.
