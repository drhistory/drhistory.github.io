## Story

The morning rush hour in Tokyo was a symphony of routine—a sea of commuters flowing through the veins of the city. But on March 20, 1995, this rhythm was shattered by an invisible terror. As trains hurtled through the tunnels, passengers began to choke, their eyes burning, their bodies convulsing. Panic spread like wildfire. The air was poisoned.

In the heart of Japan's bustling capital, the Aum Shinrikyo cult unleashed a nightmare. Their weapon? Sarin gas, a deadly nerve agent. The attack was meticulously planned, targeting five trains on three different lines of the Tokyo subway system: the Chiyoda, Marunouchi, and Hibiya lines. Cult members punctured plastic bags filled with liquid sarin, leaving them to vaporize in the crowded carriages.

The chaos was immediate and devastating. Thirteen people lost their lives, and around 5,500 were injured or affected, many suffering long-term health effects. The attack was a wake-up call for Japan, a nation that had long considered itself safe from such acts of terror.

The turning point came as emergency services and ordinary citizens sprang into action, evacuating stations and treating the afflicted. The Japanese government launched a massive manhunt, leading to the arrest of Aum Shinrikyo's leader, Shoko Asahara, on May 16, 1995, nearly two months after the attack, following extensive investigations. The cult's dark ambitions were laid bare, and their grip on fear was broken.

The Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack remains a haunting reminder of vulnerability and resilience. It reshaped Japan's approach to security and counter-terrorism, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's psyche.
