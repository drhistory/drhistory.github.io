## Story
As the sun rose over the Brazilian highlands on April 21, 1960, a new era dawned for Brazil. The air was electric with anticipation as dignitaries, citizens, and international guests gathered to witness the birth of a city unlike any other—Brasília, the new capital of Brazil.

The vision was audacious: to carve a modern metropolis out of the wilderness, a symbol of progress and unity for a nation on the rise. Designed by the visionary architect Oscar Niemeyer and the mastermind behind the urban plan, Lúcio Costa, Brasília was more than just a city; it was a statement.

The decision to move the capital from the coastal Rio de Janeiro to the heart of the country was strategic, aimed at promoting development in the interior, reducing the concentration of political power along the coast, and weakening Rio’s political elite. The city’s layout, with its sweeping curves and futuristic buildings, was a testament to the optimism and ambition of a nation eager to forge a new identity.

The inauguration was a spectacle of modernity and hope. As President Juscelino Kubitschek cut the ribbon, the world watched in awe. Brasília was not just a new capital; it was a bold experiment in urban planning and a beacon of Brazil’s aspirations.

Yet, the creation of Brasília was not without its challenges. The rapid construction came at a high cost, straining Brazil’s finances, contributing to inflation and debt. Thousands of workers and migrants, known as 'candangos,' many from the impoverished Northeast, toiled under harsh conditions to bring the city to life. Their contributions were crucial, but their living conditions were often dire, leading to early favelas on the city's periphery.

Today, Brasília stands as a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized in 1987 for its unique modernist architecture and urban design. It remains a vibrant symbol of Brazil’s journey towards modernity and its quest for a unified national identity.
