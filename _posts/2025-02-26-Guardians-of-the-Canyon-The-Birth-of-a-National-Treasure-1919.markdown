## Story

In the early 20th century, the Grand Canyon was a place of awe and inspiration, yet it faced threats from mining and unchecked tourism. Visionaries like President Theodore Roosevelt, who famously declared it 'one of the great sights which every American, if he can travel at all, must see,' championed its protection by designating it as a National Monument in 1908. This crucial step laid the groundwork for its later designation as a National Park.

The establishment of the Grand Canyon as a National Park in 1919, during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, was a pivotal moment in American conservation history. It marked a commitment to safeguarding the canyon's unique geological formations, diverse ecosystems, and cultural heritage. This act not only preserved the canyon's beauty but also set a precedent for future conservation efforts across the nation.

The Grand Canyon National Park now stands as a symbol of natural wonder and human foresight, drawing millions of visitors each year who come to marvel at its grandeur and reflect on the importance of preserving such treasures for generations to come.
