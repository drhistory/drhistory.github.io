## Story
The night sky over Kigali was tumultuous, with a storm raging as the presidential plane descended. Amidst the thunder and rain, a sudden explosion shattered the night, sending a fiery wreckage spiraling to the ground. Onboard was Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana, whose death would ignite one of the most horrific genocides in modern history.

For years, Rwanda had been a nation simmering with ethnic tension, a division deepened and institutionalized by Belgian colonial rule. The Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, once fluid identities, were turned into rigid categories by colonial policies, setting the stage for future conflict. President Habyarimana, a Hutu, had been a controversial figure, his regime marked by accusations of corruption and ethnic favoritism.

The assassination on April 6, 1994, was the spark that set the nation ablaze. Extremist Hutu factions, already trained and armed, mobilized swiftly, launching a pre-planned campaign of terror against the Tutsi population and moderate Hutus. Lists of targets had been prepared in advance, and the violence was systematic and brutal, with neighbors turning against neighbors in a frenzy of bloodshed.

The international community watched in horror, paralyzed by indecision and bureaucratic inertia. The UN peacekeeping mission (UNAMIR) was deliberately under-resourced, and key nations, including the U.S. and Belgium, withdrew troops rather than reinforcing them, exacerbating the crisis. By the time the genocide ended, an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus had been slaughtered in just 100 days, leaving a scar on the conscience of the world.

The downing of Habyarimana's plane remains a subject of debate, but the most widely accepted theory points to Hutu extremists within his own circle. They feared he would implement the Arusha Accords, which would have shared power with the Tutsi-led RPF. This tragic event serves as a stark reminder of how quickly humanity can descend into chaos, and the devastating consequences of division and hatred.
