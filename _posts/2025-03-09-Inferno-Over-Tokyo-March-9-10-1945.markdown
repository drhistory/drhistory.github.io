## Story

The night sky over Tokyo was ablaze, a hellish glow that turned darkness into day. As the clock struck midnight, the roar of B-29 bombers filled the air, their bellies loaded with incendiary bombs destined to rain destruction upon the city below. This was Operation Meetinghouse, often referred to as the Tokyo firebombing or the Great Tokyo Air Raid, a mission that would etch its name into the annals of history as one of the most devastating air raids ever conducted.

By 1945, the Pacific War had reached a critical juncture. The United States sought to cripple Japan's war production and morale, and Tokyo, the heart of the empire, was the prime target. The strategy was brutal in its simplicity: unleash a firestorm that would consume the wooden structures of the city, leaving nothing but ashes in its wake.

As the bombs fell, the city erupted into chaos. Flames leapt from building to building, creating a conflagration that devoured everything in its path. The heat was so intense that it created its own wind, a fiery tornado that swept through the streets, leaving devastation in its wake.

Estimates of the death toll vary, with figures ranging from 80,000 to over 100,000 people perishing in the inferno, and a million more were left homeless, their lives reduced to smoldering ruins.

The bombing of Tokyo was a turning point, a grim testament to the destructive power of modern warfare. It demonstrated the lengths to which nations would go to achieve victory, raising profound questions about the morality of such tactics. The city would eventually rise from the ashes, but the scars of that night would linger for generations.
