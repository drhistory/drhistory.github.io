## Story
In the early hours of April 25, 1974, the streets of Lisbon were eerily quiet, save for the soft strains of a politically charged song crackling over the radio waves. 'Grândola, Vila Morena,' a tune symbolic of the opposition, signaled the start of a revolution that would change Portugal forever.

For nearly half a century, Portugal had been under the thumb of a repressive dictatorship. The Estado Novo, primarily led by António de Oliveira Salazar (1933–1968) and later Marcelo Caetano (1968–1974), stifled political freedom and clung to its colonial possessions in Africa. But beneath the surface, discontent simmered.

The turning point came with the military coup on April 25, 1974. Unlike the violent uprisings that marked much of the 20th century, this revolution was unique. The *Movimento das Forças Armadas* (MFA), a group of junior officers, spearheaded the uprising. Soldiers, many of whom were weary from colonial wars in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau, took to the streets not with guns blazing, but with carnations in their rifle barrels. The people of Portugal joined them, flooding the streets in a jubilant display of unity and hope.

By the end of the day, the regime had crumbled. Marcelo Caetano, who had taken refuge in the Carmo Barracks, surrendered after negotiations with General António de Spínola and was exiled to Brazil. The path to democracy was paved with flowers, not blood. The Carnation Revolution not only ended decades of dictatorship but also initiated the complex process of decolonization, which unfolded over the next year (1974–1975).

The peaceful nature of the revolution and its profound impact on Portugal and its former colonies make it a remarkable chapter in history. It serves as a testament to the power of peaceful protest and the enduring human spirit.
