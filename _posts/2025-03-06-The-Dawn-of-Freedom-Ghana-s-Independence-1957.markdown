## Story

The air was electric with anticipation as the clock struck midnight on March 6, 1957. Thousands gathered at the Old Polo Grounds in Accra, their voices rising in a crescendo of hope and jubilation. The Union Jack was lowered for the last time, and in its place, the vibrant red, gold, and green of Ghana's new flag soared into the night sky. It was a moment that would echo across the continent—a beacon of freedom and a harbinger of change.

For decades, the people of the Gold Coast had lived under British colonial rule, their rich lands exploited, their voices stifled. But the winds of change were blowing. Led by the charismatic Kwame Nkrumah, the movement for independence gained unstoppable momentum. Nkrumah, a visionary leader, galvanized the masses with his rallying cry: 'Seek ye first the political kingdom, and all else shall be added unto you,' a broader statement of his political philosophy.

The journey to independence was fraught with challenges. Nkrumah and his followers faced imprisonment, political opposition, and the daunting task of uniting a diverse population. Nkrumah himself was imprisoned in 1950, but after his party, the Convention People's Party (CPP), won the elections in 1951, he was released to become the leader of government business. Yet, their resolve never wavered. On that historic night, as Nkrumah declared, 'Ghana, your beloved country, is free forever,' the world witnessed the birth of a new nation and the dawn of a new era for Africa.

Ghana's independence was not just a victory for its people but a catalyst for the decolonization of Africa. It inspired a wave of liberation movements across the continent, igniting the flames of freedom in hearts and minds from Cairo to Cape Town.
