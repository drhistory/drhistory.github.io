## Story

The air was thick with anticipation as delegates gathered in the small settlement of Washington-on-the-Brazos. It was March 2, 1836, and the fate of Texas hung in the balance. Inside a modest wooden building, a group of determined men prepared to make history. They were about to declare independence from Mexico, a bold move that would ignite a revolution.

The Convention of 1836 was a response to years of growing tensions between Texan settlers and the Mexican government. The settlers, many of whom were American immigrants, chafed under Mexican laws and the centralist policies of President Santa Anna. Initially a supporter of federalism, Santa Anna's shift to centralism and the revocation of the 1824 Constitution were key issues that angered the Texan settlers. As the Mexican government tightened its grip, the call for independence grew louder.

On that fateful day, the delegates adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence, a document that echoed the spirit of the American Declaration of 1776. It listed grievances against the Mexican government, including the denial of rights and the imposition of military rule. With their signatures, the delegates proclaimed the birth of the Republic of Texas.

This declaration was a turning point, occurring during the already underway Battle of the Alamo, which began on February 23, 1836, and ended on March 6, 1836. The declaration itself did not set off the Battle of the Alamo, but it was part of the broader Texas Revolution that eventually led to the decisive victory at San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. This victory secured Texan independence with the capture of Santa Anna.

The Republic of Texas would stand as an independent nation for nearly a decade before joining the United States. The courage of those delegates at Washington-on-the-Brazos set the stage for a new chapter in history, one that would shape the future of the American Southwest.
