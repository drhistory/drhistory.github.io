## Story

In the early hours of March 24, 1976, the streets of Buenos Aires lay eerily quiet, a deceptive calm before the storm. As the day unfolded, the silence was shattered by the rumble of military vehicles and the clatter of boots on pavement. Argentina was about to be plunged into one of its darkest chapters.

The political climate in Argentina had been simmering with tension. President Isabel Perón, struggling to maintain control amidst economic turmoil and social unrest, found herself increasingly isolated. The military, long dissatisfied with her leadership, had been planning to seize power and restore what they perceived as order.

On March 24, 1976, the military executed a coup, placing Perón under house arrest rather than ousting her in a dramatic midnight event. Tanks rolled through the capital, and soldiers took strategic positions across the country. The junta, a collective military leadership including General Jorge Rafael Videla, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera, and Brigadier General Orlando Ramón Agosti, promised stability and prosperity. But what followed was a reign of terror.

The National Reorganization Process, as the dictatorship called itself, was marked by brutal repression. Thousands of suspected dissidents were 'disappeared,' never to be seen again. The regime's iron grip stifled dissent, and fear permeated every corner of society.

The dictatorship finally crumbled in 1983, leaving behind a legacy of trauma and loss. Argentina emerged from the shadows, but the scars of those years remain etched in its collective memory.
