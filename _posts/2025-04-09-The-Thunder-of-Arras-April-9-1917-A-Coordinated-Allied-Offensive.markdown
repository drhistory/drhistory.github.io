## Story
The ground trembled beneath the boots of thousands of soldiers as the dawn sky over Arras was lit by the flash of artillery. It was April 9, 1917, and the British and Commonwealth forces, as part of a broader Allied effort including the French Nivelle Offensive further south, were about to launch one of the most ambitious offensives of World War I. The Battle of Arras had begun, aimed at drawing German reserves away from the French sector.

For months, the Western Front had been locked in a deadly stalemate, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The British High Command, determined to break the deadlock, meticulously planned an assault on the German defenses near the French city of Arras. The goal was clear: to achieve a breakthrough that would turn the tide of the war.

As the first light of day crept over the horizon, the soldiers surged forward, their hearts pounding in time with the relentless barrage of artillery. The initial assault saw significant gains, especially at Vimy Ridge, where the Canadian Corps achieved a notable victory by April 12. However, success varied across the front, with sectors like Bullecourt facing immediate setbacks due to strong German defenses and failed tank support.

But as the days wore on, the initial momentum began to falter. The Germans, resilient and resourceful, regrouped and launched fierce counterattacks. The battle devolved into a brutal war of attrition, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The main phase of the battle effectively ended by May 3, after the failure of the Third Battle of the Scarpe, though smaller operations continued into mid-May.

The British and Commonwealth forces suffered approximately 158,000 casualties, while German losses were roughly 120,000. The Battle of Arras was a testament to the courage and tenacity of the soldiers who fought there. It was a battle that demonstrated both the potential for rapid gains and the harsh reality of war's attritional nature, set against the backdrop of Allied strategic coordination.
