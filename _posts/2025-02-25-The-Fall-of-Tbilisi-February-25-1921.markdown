## Story

The streets of Tbilisi were eerily silent, the air thick with tension as the Red Army's boots marched steadily into the heart of the city. The Georgian defenders, weary and outnumbered, watched helplessly as the Soviet forces advanced, signaling the end of their brief independence.

In the aftermath of World War I, Georgia had seized the opportunity to declare independence, forming the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918. For a few short years, the nation thrived, embracing democracy and reform. But the shadow of the Soviet Union loomed large, and by 1921, the Red Army was on the move, determined to bring Georgia into the fold of Soviet republics as part of a broader strategy of Soviet expansionism in the Caucasus.

The invasion was not a sudden, unilateral decision but was influenced by internal Soviet politics and the geopolitical situation in the region. Despite significant and fierce resistance, involving several battles, the Georgian forces were eventually overwhelmed. The Red Army's entry into Tbilisi on February 25th marked a significant moment, particularly for Georgia, as it was the last of the three South Caucasus republics to fall under Soviet control, following Armenia and Azerbaijan's Sovietization in 1920.

The aftermath was a somber one. The Democratic Republic of Georgia was dissolved, and Soviet rule was established, altering the course of Georgian history for decades to come. The dreams of independence were crushed, but the spirit of resistance lived on in the hearts of the Georgian people, with guerrilla warfare persisting in some regions even after the fall of Tbilisi.
