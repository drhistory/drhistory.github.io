## Story

The ink was barely dry on the parchment when the news spread like wildfire across the Atlantic. On March 22, 1765, the British Parliament had passed the Stamp Act, a decree that would forever alter the course of history. Colonists in America, already simmering with discontent, now faced a new and direct tax on every piece of printed paper they used. From newspapers to legal documents, even playing cards, nothing was spared from the reach of this new law.

The British Empire, burdened by debt from the Seven Years' War, saw the colonies as a source of untapped revenue. The Stamp Act was their solution—a seemingly simple tax to help cover the costs of maintaining British troops in America. But to the colonists, it was an affront, a violation of their rights as Englishmen. 'No taxation without representation!' became their rallying cry, echoing through the streets and taverns of Boston, Philadelphia, and beyond.

The turning point came not from the act itself, but from the reaction it provoked. The colonies, once disparate and divided, began to unite in opposition. The Stamp Act Congress convened in New York in October 1765, bringing together representatives from nine colonies to voice their grievances. Boycotts of British goods were organized, and the Sons of Liberty, a secret society, emerged to resist the act through protest and intimidation.

By the time the British government repealed the Stamp Act on March 18, 1766, the damage was done. The seeds of revolution had been sown, and the colonies were on an irreversible path toward independence. The Stamp Act, intended as a simple fiscal measure, had ignited a fire that would eventually consume an empire.
