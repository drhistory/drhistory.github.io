## Story
The sun rose over Asmara on May 24, 1993, casting a golden hue over a city brimming with anticipation and hope. Streets once echoing with the sounds of conflict now resonated with jubilant cries of freedom. Eritrea, after a grueling 30-year struggle, was finally free.

The journey to this historic day was fraught with hardship and sacrifice. For decades, Eritreans had fought against Ethiopian rule, driven by a fierce desire for self-determination. The conflict, which began in 1961 when Hamid Idris Awate fired the first shots against Ethiopian forces, saw generations of Eritreans take up arms, enduring unimaginable hardships in the pursuit of independence.

The turning point came in 1991 when Eritrean forces, primarily the EPLF, captured Asmara as part of a coordinated effort with the Tigrayan-led TPLF during the broader collapse of the Derg regime in Ethiopia. This was a pivotal moment in the wider Ethiopian civil war context.

However, it wasn't until a referendum in April 1993, organized by the Eritrean provisional government and overseen by the UN to observe and certify the fairness of the process, that the world recognized Eritrea's sovereignty. An overwhelming 99.8% of Eritreans voted for independence, with near-universal participation (98.5% turnout), a testament to their unwavering resolve and the formality of the vote after years of de facto independence.

On that fateful day in May, Eritrea's flag was raised high, a symbol of resilience and hope. The streets were alive with celebration, as people danced and sang, embracing a future they had long dreamed of. Eritrea was now a nation reborn, though its post-independence trajectory under Isaias Afwerki's authoritarian rule would diverge from the initial hopes of democracy and development many had envisioned.

The road to independence was long and arduous, but the spirit of the Eritrean people never wavered. Their story is a powerful reminder of the strength of human will and the enduring quest for freedom.
