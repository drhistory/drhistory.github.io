## Story
In the bustling chambers of the United States Congress on April 4, 1818, a decision was made that would forever alter the fabric of American identity. The Flag Act of 1818 was not just a legislative act; it was a bold statement of unity and growth for a young nation finding its place in the world.

The United States was expanding rapidly, with new states joining the Union. The flag, a symbol of national pride, needed to reflect this growth. Prior to 1818, the flag had been altered to include 15 stripes (for Vermont and Kentucky) under the Flag Act of 1794, not continuously increasing them. The 1818 act reverted to 13 stripes to honor the original colonies while allowing stars to expand.

The Flag Act of 1818 was a practical adjustment to a growing nation. It decreed that the flag would have 13 stripes, representing the original colonies, and a star for each state. While it became customary to add a new star on the 4th of July following the admission of a new state, the act itself did not explicitly mandate this timing—it simply stated that stars would be added for new states.

This act was more than a design choice; it was a commitment to unity and a vision for the future. As each star was added, it symbolized not just a new state, but a new chapter in the American story. The flag became a living document, a testament to the country's enduring spirit and boundless potential.

Today, the American flag is recognized worldwide, its stars and stripes a powerful emblem of freedom and democracy. The Flag Act of 1818 laid the foundation for this iconic symbol, ensuring it would grow with the nation it represents.
