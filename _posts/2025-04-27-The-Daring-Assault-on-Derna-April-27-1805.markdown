## Story
The sun rose over the Libyan desert, casting long shadows over the city of Derna. On April 27, 1805, a small but determined force prepared to make history. Led by the audacious civilian diplomat William Eaton and supported by First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon's eight U.S. Marines, alongside a few dozen Greek and Arab mercenaries and several hundred local allies loyal to Hamet Karamanli, their mission was as bold as it was dangerous: to capture the city of Derna from the Barbary pirates and raise the American flag over a captured foreign city for the first time in a military victory.

The First Barbary War had been raging, a conflict born from the refusal of the United States to pay tribute to the Barbary States for safe passage of their ships. The stakes were high, and the young nation was determined to assert its sovereignty.

Eaton's plan was unconventional. With his mixed force, he embarked on a grueling 520-mile march, following coastal routes and receiving some supplies by sea, not entirely through desert as often imagined. The odds were against them, but their resolve was unshakable.

As the battle commenced, the defenders of Derna, loyal to Yusuf Karamanli, the Pasha of Tripoli, were aware of Eaton’s approach but underestimated his ability to rally local support. The Marines and their allies stormed the city with a ferocity that belied their numbers. Cannon fire echoed through the streets, and the clash of swords rang out as the Americans fought their way to victory.

By the end of the day, the city was theirs. The American flag was hoisted high, a symbol of triumph and a testament to the courage and tenacity of those who fought. This victory at Derna was not just a military success; it was a statement to the world that the United States would not be cowed by tyranny.

The Battle of Derna became a legendary chapter in Marine Corps history, immortalized in the Marines' Hymn with the line 'to the shores of Tripoli,' symbolizing the broader war effort, even though the Marines did not actually reach Tripoli itself.
