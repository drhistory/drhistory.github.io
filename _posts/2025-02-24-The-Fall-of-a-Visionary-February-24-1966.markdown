## Story

In the morning of February 24, 1966, the streets of Accra were eerily quiet, save for the distant rumble of military vehicles. As dawn broke, the airwaves crackled with an announcement that would change the course of Ghanaian history: President Kwame Nkrumah had been overthrown. The man who had led Ghana to independence was now a leader in exile.

Kwame Nkrumah, a charismatic and visionary leader, had been the face of Ghana's independence from British colonial rule in 1957. His dream was to transform Ghana into a beacon of African unity and progress. However, by 1966, his government was accused of economic mismanagement and authoritarian practices. While Nkrumah was on a diplomatic mission in Beijing, China, having just left North Vietnam, the National Liberation Council seized the opportunity to stage a coup.

The coup was swift and decisive. The military, supported by the police, took control of key installations and declared the government dissolved. Nkrumah, informed of the events shortly after they happened, was left stranded abroad, his dreams of a united Africa shattered.

This turning point marked the end of Nkrumah's ambitious plans and the beginning of a new era for Ghana. The National Liberation Council promised to restore democracy and address the economic challenges facing the nation. Yet, the legacy of Nkrumah's overthrow remains a topic of debate, symbolizing both the fragility of post-colonial leadership and the complex path to African self-governance.

As Ghana grappled with its new reality, the world watched, wondering what the future held for this young nation.
