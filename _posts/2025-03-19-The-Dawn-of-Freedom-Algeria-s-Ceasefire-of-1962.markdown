## Story

The air was thick with anticipation on March 19, 1962, as the first light of dawn crept over the rugged Algerian landscape. For the first time in nearly eight years, the guns fell silent. The Evian Accords, signed on March 18, 1962, had finally brought a ceasefire to the war-torn nation. The Algerian War of Independence, a brutal conflict that had claimed between 300,000 to 1.5 million lives, was drawing to a close.

The struggle for Algerian independence had been long and bloody. Since 1954, the National Liberation Front (FLN) had waged a relentless guerrilla war against French colonial forces. The conflict was marked by atrocities on both sides, with civilians often caught in the crossfire. The war had not only torn apart Algeria but had also deeply divided France, leading to political turmoil and the fall of the Fourth Republic in 1958, which was partly due to the Algerian crisis and led to the establishment of the Fifth Republic under Charles de Gaulle.

The turning point came with the Evian Accords, negotiated in the picturesque town of Évian-les-Bains, France. These agreements granted Algeria self-determination and laid the groundwork for a peaceful transition to independence. The ceasefire on March 19 was a monumental step, signaling the end of colonial rule and the birth of a new nation.

Yet, the path to peace was fraught with challenges. As the ceasefire took effect, tensions simmered beneath the surface. The transition to independence was not without its hurdles, as factions within Algeria vied for power and the remnants of French settlers faced an uncertain future.

The ceasefire of 1962 was more than just an end to hostilities; it was the dawn of a new era for Algeria. The nation would soon stand on its own, free from colonial chains, ready to forge its destiny.
