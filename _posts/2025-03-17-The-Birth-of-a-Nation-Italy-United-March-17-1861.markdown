## Story

The air was electric with anticipation as the grand halls of the Palazzo Carignano in Turin echoed with the sound of history in the making. On March 17, 1861, a new dawn broke over the Italian Peninsula. The Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed, and the dream of a united Italy, long nurtured by patriots and visionaries, was finally realized.

For centuries, Italy had been a patchwork of competing states, duchies, and kingdoms, each with its own ruler and interests. The Risorgimento, a movement fueled by the ideals of nationalism and unity, sought to change that. It was a time of revolution, war, and diplomacy, with figures like Giuseppe Garibaldi and Count Camillo di Cavour leading the charge.

The proclamation in the Palazzo Carignano was the culmination of years of struggle and sacrifice. Victor Emmanuel II, of the House of Savoy, was declared the first king of a united Italy. The moment was both a triumph and a beginning, as the new nation faced the daunting task of integrating its diverse regions and peoples into a cohesive whole.

Yet, the unification was not complete. Rome and Venetia remained outside the new kingdom's borders. Venetia would be incorporated into Italy in 1866 following the Austro-Prussian War and the subsequent Treaty of Vienna. Rome would not be incorporated until 1870, after the capture of Rome, marking the final act of Italian unification. But on that day in March, the foundation was laid, and the world witnessed the birth of a nation.

The Kingdom of Italy was more than a political entity; it was a symbol of hope and a testament to the power of unity and determination.
