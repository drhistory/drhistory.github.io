## Story
In the sweltering heat of a Philadelphia summer, the air inside the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) was thick with anticipation. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia rose to his feet, his voice steady and resolute. 'Resolved,' he declared, 'that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States.' The room fell silent, the weight of his words hanging in the air. This was no ordinary proposal. It was a bold call for freedom, a daring challenge to the might of the British Empire.

The colonies had been simmering with discontent, their patience worn thin by oppressive taxes and distant rule. But to declare independence was to step into the unknown, to risk everything for the hope of self-determination.

Lee's resolution was the spark that ignited the flame of American independence. It set in motion a series of events that would culminate in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. After a brief delay while Congress debated Lee's resolution, the Continental Congress, recognizing the gravity of the moment, appointed a committee on June 11, 1776, to draft a formal declaration. Among them was Thomas Jefferson, whose eloquent pen would soon give voice to the colonies' aspirations.

The turning point came on July 2, 1776, when the Continental Congress voted in favor of Lee's resolution. Two days later, on July 4, Congress approved the final edited text of the Declaration of Independence, forever changing the course of history.

Most delegates signed it weeks later, with August 2, 1776, being the traditional date for the signing. Lee's resolution was more than just words on paper; it was a bold assertion of the colonies' right to self-governance, a declaration of their intent to forge a new path. It was the beginning of a revolution that would inspire generations to come.
