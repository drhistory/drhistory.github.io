## The story

The roar of the Atlas rocket was deafening, a symphony of power and ambition that shook the very ground of Cape Canaveral. Inside the cramped confines of the Friendship 7 spacecraft, John Glenn felt the immense force pressing him back into his seat. His heart raced with the thrill of the unknown as he embarked on a journey that would etch his name into the annals of history.

In the early 1960s, the Space Race was a high-stakes game of technological prowess and national pride. The Soviet Union had already claimed the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, and the United States was determined to catch up. John Glenn, a decorated Marine Corps pilot, was chosen to be the first American to orbit the Earth, a mission fraught with danger and uncertainty.

As Friendship 7 soared into the heavens, Glenn marveled at the breathtaking view of Earth from space—a sight few had ever seen. But the mission was not without its challenges. During the flight, a warning light indicated a significant concern with the heat shield, a critical component for re-entry. The tension was palpable as mission control and Glenn weighed the risks, knowing that a failure could mean disaster. As a precaution, the retrorocket pack was left attached to help hold the heat shield in place during re-entry.

Despite the odds, Glenn's calm demeanor and the expertise of the NASA team ensured a safe return. After approximately 4 hours and 55 minutes and three orbits, Friendship 7 splashed down in the North Atlantic Ocean, specifically about 800 miles southeast of Bermuda, and John Glenn emerged as a national hero. His successful mission not only bolstered American morale but also marked a pivotal moment in the Space Race, proving that the United States was a formidable contender in the quest for the stars.

The legacy of John Glenn's flight endures, a testament to human courage and the relentless pursuit of exploration.
