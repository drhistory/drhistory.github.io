## Story
The halls of Congress buzzed with tension on May 12, 1846. Lawmakers, their faces set with determination, gathered to cast a vote that would alter the course of two nations. The United States was about to approve a declaration of war on Mexico, a decision that President Polk would sign into law on May 13, igniting the Mexican-American War.

The roots of this conflict ran deep. The annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845 had been a thorn in Mexico's side, a bold move that challenged territorial boundaries and national pride. The immediate trigger, however, was the Thornton Affair on April 25, 1846, where Mexican forces clashed with U.S. troops in the disputed territory between the Nueces and Rio Grande. Polk used this skirmish to justify his war message to Congress, claiming Mexico had shed 'American blood on American soil.'

The Nueces River was historically the recognized border of Mexican Texas, while the U.S. claim to the Rio Grande represented a newer, aggressive stance. This territorial dispute became a key flashpoint in the lead-up to war.

As the vote was cast, the air was thick with anticipation. The decision was made: war. The United States, driven by the spirit of Manifest Destiny and the official justification of the Thornton Affair, sought to expand its borders, while Mexico stood firm, unwilling to cede its northern territories. The war was controversial, with figures like Abraham Lincoln and Henry David Thoreau opposing it.

The war that followed was brutal and transformative. Battles raged from Texas to California, reshaping the map and the future of North America. By the time the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848, the United States had gained California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming—about 55% of Mexico's pre-war territory.

The declaration of war on those fateful days was more than a political maneuver; it was a turning point that defined the destiny of a continent.
