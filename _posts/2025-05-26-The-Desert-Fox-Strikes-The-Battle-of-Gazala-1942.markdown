## Story
The scorching sun beat down mercilessly on the Libyan desert as the engines of German panzers roared to life. It was late in the evening of May 26th, 1942, and the stage was set for one of the most pivotal confrontations of the Western Desert Campaign. The Battle of Gazala was about to begin, and at its helm was the legendary Erwin Rommel, the 'Desert Fox,' whose cunning tactics would soon be put to the ultimate test.

The British Eighth Army, entrenched and ready, awaited the Axis onslaught. Their defenses stretched from the Mediterranean coast to the desert's edge, a formidable line that Rommel was determined to breach. With a mix of audacity and strategic brilliance, Rommel launched his offensive under cover of darkness, a sweeping maneuver that would become known as the 'right hook' or 'flanking attack around Bir Hakeim.'

The initial Axis assault was a masterclass in surprise and speed. Rommel's forces, including the feared Afrika Korps, executed a daring flanking movement, bypassing the heavily fortified British positions. The British, caught off guard, scrambled to respond, leading to a series of intense and chaotic engagements across the desert sands.

The turning point came when Rommel's forces encircled the British stronghold at Bir Hakeim, defended by the Free French Brigade. Despite fierce resistance, the Axis forces eventually broke through, but the decisive moment was the Axis breakthrough at 'The Cauldron' (June 1-5), where Rommel resupplied and counterattacked after being temporarily trapped.

The fall of Tobruk came later, on June 21, 1942, after the British retreat from Gazala left Tobruk isolated, leading to its rapid capture. The Battle of Gazala was a testament to the brutal and unpredictable nature of desert warfare. It reshaped the balance of power in North Africa and set the stage for future confrontations.
