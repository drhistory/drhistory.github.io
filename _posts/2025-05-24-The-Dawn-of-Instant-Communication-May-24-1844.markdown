## Story
In the hushed halls of the **Supreme Court chamber** inside the U.S. Capitol, a small group gathered around a curious device. It was May 24, 1844, and Samuel Morse was about to change the world. With a steady hand, he tapped out a message that would echo through history: 'What hath God wrought.'

The world was on the brink of a communication revolution. Until that moment, messages traveled at the speed of a horse or a ship. But Morse, with his telegraph, promised something extraordinary: instant communication over vast distances. The message, sent from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland, was a simple biblical phrase chosen by **Annie Ellsworth**, yet it heralded a new era.

The telegraph line, stretching 40 miles, was a marvel of engineering and vision. It was the culmination of years of work, experimentation, and perseverance by Morse and his partner, **Alfred Vail**, who played a crucial role in refining the Morse code and the telegraph's mechanics. As the message was received by Vail in Baltimore, the significance of the moment began to dawn on those present. The impossible had become possible.

This moment was more than just a technological triumph; it was a turning point in human connection. The telegraph shrank the world, laying the groundwork for the global communication networks we rely on today. It was the first step toward the interconnected world we now take for granted.
