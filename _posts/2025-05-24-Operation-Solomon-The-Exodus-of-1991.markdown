## Story
In the early hours of May 24, 1991, the skies above Ethiopia were filled with the hum of engines as a fleet of Israeli aircraft descended upon Addis Ababa. This was no ordinary mission; it was Operation Solomon, a daring and unprecedented airlift to rescue thousands of Ethiopian Jews from a land on the brink of chaos.

The political landscape in Ethiopia was crumbling. Civil war raged, and the government was on the verge of collapse. For the Beta Israel community, Ethiopian Jews who had long faced persecution, the situation was dire. Israel, recognizing the urgency, orchestrated a coordinated operation with the Ethiopian government to bring them to safety.

In a meticulously planned operation, around 34 aircraft, including El Al 747s, C-130 Hercules transports, and Israeli Air Force planes, were deployed. Over approximately 34 intense hours (May 24–25, 1991), 14,325 (or roughly 14,300) Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel. The Boeing 747 set a world record, carrying 1,088 passengers in a single flight, a testament to the operation's scale and urgency.

The turning point came as the planes touched down in Israel, where the passengers were greeted with open arms. It was a moment of triumph, a testament to human resilience and the unyielding spirit of a people yearning for freedom, though many would face significant cultural and social challenges in their new home.

Operation Solomon was more than a rescue mission; it was a beacon of hope, a reminder of the lengths to which nations will go to protect their own. It stands as a powerful example of humanitarian effort and the enduring bond between the Jewish diaspora and the state of Israel.
