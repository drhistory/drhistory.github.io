Pompidou, a man of intellect and vision, had been at the helm of France since 1969. His presidency was marked by efforts to modernize the French economy and maintain the country's influence on the global stage. Yet, behind the scenes, Pompidou was fighting a battle against Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a rare form of blood cancer. His frailty was publicly visible, though the exact nature of his illness was not fully disclosed.

Despite his illness, Pompidou remained dedicated to his duties, determined to lead France through turbulent times. But on that fateful April day, his body succumbed to the disease, leaving a nation in shock and mourning.

The sudden vacancy in the presidency necessitated an election within 20–35 days, as per constitutional rules, thrusting France into a whirlwind of political activity. The country had to quickly come to terms with the loss of a leader while preparing to choose his successor. The election that followed was a pivotal moment, contributing to the broader political shift already underway and setting the stage for a new era.

Pompidou's death was not just the end of a presidency; it was a turning point that forced France to confront its political landscape and the fragility of leadership.
