## Story
The desert sands of Pokhran lay still under the scorching sun, a deceptive calm before the storm. On May 11, 1998, the silence was shattered by a series of earth-shaking explosions. India had just announced its arrival on the global nuclear stage with Operation Shakti.

The world watched with mixed reactions as the news broke. India, a nation that had consistently refused to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) while supporting global disarmament in principle, had conducted nuclear tests. These tests included three separate explosions on May 11: one thermonuclear device, one fission device, and three sub-kiloton devices detonated simultaneously, followed by two additional sub-kiloton tests on May 13. This move was a bold statement of self-reliance and strategic autonomy, signaling India's readiness to defend its sovereignty amidst a complex security environment.

The roots of this decision were deeply embedded in India's geopolitical landscape. The 1974 'Smiling Buddha' test was not solely security-driven but also a demonstration of scientific capability during peacetime. The 1998 tests, however, were overtly strategic, timed after Pakistan's missile tests and amid rising tensions, and served both as deterrence against Pakistan and China and as a fulfillment of the BJP's nationalist agenda.

The international community's reaction was swift but varied. Sanctions were primarily imposed by the US and Japan, with key partners like Russia and France avoiding harsh measures. The US began normalizing relations within two years, highlighting India's relative and short-lived diplomatic isolation. The tests had a profound impact on India's national psyche, fostering a sense of pride and unity, and forcing the world to reckon with a new nuclear power determined to chart its own course.

As the dust settled over Pokhran, the implications of Operation Shakti were clear. India had altered the balance of power in South Asia and challenged the global nuclear order. The tests, especially the sub-kiloton ones on May 13, sparked debates on nuclear proliferation and the ethics of nuclear deterrence, given claims they violated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) spirit, despite India not being a signatory. These debates continue to resonate today.
