## Story
Dawn broke over the serene landscapes of France and the Low Countries on May 10th, 1940, but the tranquility was short-lived. The sky roared with the engines of the Luftwaffe, and the ground trembled under the relentless advance of German panzers. The Blitzkrieg had begun, and Europe was about to witness warfare like never before.

The German invasion of France and the Low Countries was a meticulously planned operation, designed to bypass the heavily fortified Maginot Line and strike at the heart of France through Belgium and the Netherlands. The strategy was audacious, relying on speed, surprise, and overwhelming force.

As the German forces surged forward, the Allies, while having some intelligence warnings, misjudged the main axis of the attack, underestimating the feasibility of a large-scale armored thrust through the dense Ardennes terrain. The critical moment came with the breakthrough at Sedan on May 13–14, just three to four days after the invasion began, marking a pivotal point in the German offensive.

The turning point came with the encirclement of Allied forces at Dunkirk. The German advance was swift, but it was also the strategic hesitation, notably Hitler's 'Halt Order' on May 24–26, that allowed the Allies crucial time to organize the desperate evacuation known as Operation Dynamo.

By June, Paris was declared an open city and occupied without major fighting on June 14, with the armistice signed on June 22. The French government had already been collapsing before the fall of Paris.

The fall of France in 1940 was a shock to the world, demonstrating the devastating effectiveness of Blitzkrieg tactics and altering the course of World War II. It was a stark reminder of the perils of underestimating an enemy and the importance of adaptability in warfare. Despite the rapid collapse, pockets of French resistance, such as at Lille and the Alps, held out fiercely, highlighting that not all French forces succumbed immediately to the German onslaught.
