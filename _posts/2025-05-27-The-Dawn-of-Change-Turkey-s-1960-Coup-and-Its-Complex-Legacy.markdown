## Story
In the early hours of May 27, 1960, the streets of Ankara were eerily quiet, save for the distant rumble of military vehicles. As dawn broke, the Turkish nation awoke to a new reality—one that would alter its political landscape forever. The military had seized control, marking the first coup d'état in the history of the Republic of Turkey.

The 1950s had been a decade of transformation for Turkey, with Prime Minister Adnan Menderes at the helm. His government, initially celebrated for its economic reforms and democratic promises, gradually faced criticism for suppressing secularism, violating the constitution, and economic mismanagement. Tensions simmered as Menderes' Democratic Party clashed with the military and opposition groups, leading to widespread unrest.

The turning point came on that fateful May morning when a group of mid-ranking military officers, including Colonel Alparslan Türkeş and the '38 subaltern officers,' executed a meticulously planned coup. General Cemal Gürsel was later brought in to lend legitimacy to the movement. Tanks rolled through the capital, and radio broadcasts announced the overthrow of Menderes' government. The coup leaders framed their actions as a 'revolution' (ihtilal), necessary to restore order and secularism.

The aftermath was profound. Menderes and two of his ministers, Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Hasan Polatkan, were arrested and subjected to the controversial Yassıada trials by the military-backed High Court of Justice. They were executed in September 1961, while many others were imprisoned or purged. The military established the National Unity Committee (Milli Birlik Komitesi) to govern temporarily, but internal divisions led to a second coup in 1960 when more radical officers, like Türkeş, were expelled.

The 1960 coup introduced a new constitution in 1961, which expanded civil liberties but also institutionalized military oversight, entrenching the military's role as a self-appointed guardian of secularism and order. This set a precedent for future interventions in 1971, 1980, and 1997. It was a moment that not only reshaped Turkey's governance but also left an indelible mark on its democratic journey.
