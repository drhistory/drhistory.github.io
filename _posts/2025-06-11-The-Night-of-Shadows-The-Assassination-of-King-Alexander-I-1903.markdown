## Story
In the dead of night on June 11, 1903, the royal palace in Belgrade stood vulnerable, its corridors not the dimly lit fortress of legend but a place where guards either turned a blind eye or were part of the conspiracy. A group of discontented army officers, their hearts pounding with treasonous resolve, moved with ease through the palace, their mission clear: to end the reign of King Alexander I of Serbia.

The kingdom of Serbia was a cauldron of political unrest. King Alexander I, a ruler whose decisions had often sparked controversy, was at the center of a storm. His marriage to Queen Draga, a former lady-in-waiting, had been particularly unpopular, fueling rumors and dissent among the nobility and military alike. The king's attempts to consolidate power only deepened the rift between him and his subjects.

As the clock ticked past midnight, the conspirators, including key figures like Captain Aleksandar Mašin and Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandar Knežević, made their way to the royal chambers with little resistance. The air was thick with tension as they carried out their grim task. King Alexander and Queen Draga were subjected to a horrifying end—shot, stabbed, and thrown from a palace window, their bodies mutilated in the process.

This violent upheaval marked the fall of the Obrenović dynasty, leading to the restoration of the Karađorđević dynasty, with Peter I Karađorđević chosen as the new king. The assassination sent shockwaves through Europe, altering the course of Serbian history. While it destabilized Serbia, the coup did not directly cause the later Balkan Wars or WWI, though some conspirators, like Dragutin Dimitrijević ('Apis'), would play roles in those events.

The echoes of that fateful night still resonate today, a stark reminder of the volatile nature of power and the lengths to which men will go to seize it.
