## Story

The air was thick with tension as approximately 600 civil rights activists gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Their mission was clear: to march peacefully to Montgomery and demand the right to vote.

By 1965, the fight for civil rights in America had reached a boiling point. Despite the constitutional right to vote, African Americans in the South faced insurmountable barriers. The march from Selma to Montgomery was a bold statement against this injustice, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and led by figures like John Lewis and Hosea Williams. Other leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr., were also involved in the broader Selma campaign, although King was not present at the march on 'Bloody Sunday.'

As the marchers crossed the bridge, they were confronted by a phalanx of state troopers and local law enforcement. Without warning, the officers charged, wielding clubs and tear gas. The peaceful protestors were beaten back, their cries for justice drowned out by the chaos. The brutality of 'Bloody Sunday' was broadcast across the nation, shocking the conscience of America.

This turning point galvanized support for the civil rights movement, contributing to the series of events that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The courage of those who faced violence on the bridge paved the way for a new era of equality and justice in the United States.
