## Story
The air was electric with anticipation on May 9, 1901, as the streets of Melbourne thronged with people eager to witness history in the making. Flags fluttered in the crisp autumn breeze, and the city was alive with the sound of celebration. This was no ordinary day; it was the ceremonial opening of the first federal Parliament of Australia by the Duke of Cornwall and York, Prince George, who would later become King George V in 1910.

The Duke stood before the gathered crowd, his presence a symbol of the ties between the new Commonwealth and the British Empire. As he declared the Parliament open, a cheer erupted, echoing the hopes and dreams of a young nation ready to chart its own course. However, it's important to note that the first official parliamentary session had already begun on March 29, 1901, in the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, where legislative business commenced.

The journey to this moment had been long and fraught with challenges. The six separate colonies of Australia had finally come together, united under a single constitution, to form the Commonwealth of Australia on January 1, 1901. This unification was a testament to the vision and determination of leaders who believed in a federated Australia. The first federal elections were held in March 1901, leading to the first parliamentary session shortly after.

The ceremonial opening of Parliament in May was more than just an event; it was a turning point that marked the beginning of a new era. The legislative body would now tackle the pressing issues of the day, from immigration to trade, setting the stage for Australia’s future as a nation. It's crucial to remember that this Parliament met in the Royal Exhibition Building, as the federal capital and a dedicated parliamentary structure in Canberra had not yet been established.

As the first session commenced, the weight of responsibility was palpable. The decisions made within those walls would shape the destiny of millions. It was a moment of pride, of potential, and of promise.
