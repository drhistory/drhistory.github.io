## Story
The air was thick with tension in Beirut on April 13, 1975. The city, a vibrant mosaic of cultures and religions, was about to become the epicenter of a conflict that would tear a nation apart. As the sun rose, few could have predicted that this day would mark the beginning of a brutal civil war that would last for 15 long years.

It all began with a seemingly isolated incident. A bus carrying Palestinians and Lebanese Muslims was ambushed by Phalangist (Christian) militiamen in the Christian suburb of Ain el-Rummaneh, leaving 27 dead. This attack was not just a random act of violence; it was the spark that ignited a powder keg of sectarian tensions that had been simmering beneath the surface of Lebanese society.

Lebanon, a country of diverse religious and ethnic groups, had long been a delicate balance of power. But by the mid-1970s, this balance was under strain. Political and economic disparities, exacerbated by the confessional system's inequities and the influx of Palestinian refugees, had created a volatile environment. The presence of armed Palestinian factions operating outside state control further deepened Christian-Muslim distrust. The bus attack was the catalyst that unleashed a wave of violence, as militias formed along religious lines, and foreign powers, escalating their involvement later, began to intervene, each with their own agendas.

The war that followed was a complex tapestry of shifting alliances and brutal battles. Beirut, once known as the 'Paris of the Middle East,' became a city divided, its streets echoing with gunfire and shelling. The conflict claimed the lives of an estimated 120,000 to 150,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

When the war finally ended in 1990, with the Taif Agreement marking its political conclusion, Lebanon was left scarred and fragmented, its society deeply divided. The legacy of the civil war continues to shape the country's politics and social fabric to this day.
