**TLDR;**
- **Event**: On June 13, 1944, London was attacked by V-1 flying bombs, known as 'Doodlebugs', marking the first operational use of these early cruise missiles by Germany.
- **Impact**: The V-1s caused significant destruction and psychological terror, with their engines cutting out just before impact, leaving a moment of silence before explosion.
- **Response**: Initial countermeasures were ineffective, but over time, anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and fast fighters like the Tempest and Spitfire XIV were deployed to intercept the bombs.
- **Legacy**: The V-1 attacks introduced the concept of autonomous, long-range weapons, paving the way for modern missile technology and changing the nature of warfare.

## Story
The skies over London were deceptively calm on the morning of June 13, 1944. But as the city stirred to life, a new and terrifying sound filled the air—a low, ominous buzzing that grew louder and louder. It was the sound of the V-1 flying bomb, the first operational use of the V-1 flying bomb, hurtling towards the city at over 400 miles per hour.

Dubbed 'Doodlebugs' by the British, these early cruise missiles were Germany's latest weapon in their relentless assault on London. The V-1 was a marvel of engineering, a pilotless aircraft powered by a pulsejet engine, designed to deliver destruction indiscriminately over a broad area.

As the first V-1 struck, the impact was devastating. Buildings crumbled, fires raged, and the people of London were thrust into a new phase of the war. The psychological impact was immense; the V-1s could strike without warning, their engines cutting out just before impact, leaving a haunting silence before the explosion.

This attack marked the beginning of a terrifying campaign that would see thousands of these bombs launched at London and other parts of England. While countermeasures were developed quickly (like anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and fast fighters like the Tempest and Spitfire XIV), initial interception efforts were not immediately effective. It took weeks to refine tactics. Yet, the V-1s continued to rain down, a grim reminder of the war's relentless march.

The introduction of the V-1 flying bomb changed the nature of warfare, ushering in an era of autonomous, long-range precision weapons. It was a harbinger of the missile age, a precursor to the modern weapons that define today's conflicts, though it was more of a terror weapon than a precision strike system.
