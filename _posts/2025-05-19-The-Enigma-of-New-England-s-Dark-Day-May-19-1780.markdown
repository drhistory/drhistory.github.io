## Story
The sun rose on May 19, 1780, under an already unusually hazy sky, a precursor to the unprecedented darkness that would engulf New England by midday. The sky, gradually turning an ominous shade of black, plunged the region into an eerie, premature nightfall. Panic spread like wildfire through the towns and villages, with many fearing it was the end of days.

In the midst of the American Revolutionary War, the people of New England were no strangers to uncertainty. Yet, this was different. The darkness was so profound that candles were lit at midday, and livestock returned to their barns, confused by the sudden nightfall. The air was thick with the smell of smoke from massive wildfires in Canada and the American frontier, the primary cause of the darkness, combined with a dense fog and heavy cloud cover, creating a blanket that obscured the sun.

While some contemporary scholars, including Harvard professors, correctly theorized that wildfires were the cause based on the smoky smell and ash residue, many preachers interpreted it as a sign of God’s wrath, particularly due to the ongoing Revolutionary War. Some even believed it fulfilled biblical prophecies.

The Dark Day of 1780 remains a testament to the power of nature and the fear of the unknown. It was a day that challenged the understanding of the world and left an indelible mark on the collective memory of those who witnessed it.
