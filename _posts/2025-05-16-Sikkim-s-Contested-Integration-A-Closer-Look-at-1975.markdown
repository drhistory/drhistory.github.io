## Story
The air was thick with anticipation in the Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim on May 16, 1975. The streets of Gangtok, the capital, buzzed with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. The people of Sikkim were on the brink of a monumental change, one that would redefine their identity and future.

For centuries, Sikkim had been a kingdom nestled in the mountains, ruled by the Chogyal dynasty. However, the winds of change were blowing. Political unrest, fueled by India's support for pro-democracy and pro-India factions, had been growing louder. The Chogyal, Palden Thondup Namgyal, found himself caught between his people's aspirations and his own resistance to full integration with India.

The turning point came not with a direct referendum but through a vote in the Sikkimese Assembly, dominated by pro-India factions, and a controversial public opinion poll conducted by India. The process was marred by a lack of transparency, and the claim of an 'overwhelming yes' is debated to this day. India's role was far from passive; it blockaded Sikkim to pressure the monarchy and deployed the Indian Army to ensure control during the transition.

On that historic day in May, Sikkim officially became the 22nd state of India. The monarchy had already been abolished in April 1975, and the Chogyal's reign came to an end. While the transition was smooth, it was not entirely consensual. Some Sikkimese, particularly the Bhutia-Lepcha elite, opposed the merger.

The integration of Sikkim into India brought development and progress but also led to demographic shifts and the political marginalization of some indigenous groups. Today, Sikkim stands as a testament to the complexities of political change, where the lines between voluntary integration and strategic annexation blur.
