As the Vietnam War drew to a close, the fall of Saigon loomed ominously on the horizon. In a desperate bid to save the most vulnerable, the United States, primarily, launched Operation Babylift. The mission was clear: evacuate thousands of orphans and children from South Vietnam to safety in the United States, Australia, France, Canada, and beyond.

The operation was fraught with challenges from the start. The first large-scale flight, a C-5A Galaxy, tragically crashed shortly after takeoff on April 4, killing 138 people, including dozens of children. Yet, the mission pressed on, driven by the urgency of the situation and the hope of a better future for these children.

Over the course of the operation, nearly 3,000 children were airlifted to safety. Each flight was a race against time, a testament to the courage and compassion of those involved. For many of these children, it was a journey from the uncertainty of war to the promise of a new life.

Operation Babylift remains a poignant reminder of the human cost of conflict and the enduring power of hope and humanity in the face of adversity.
