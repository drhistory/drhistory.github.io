## Story
In the early hours of May 29, 1914, the RMS Empress of Ireland glided through the calm waters of the Saint Lawrence River, her passengers blissfully unaware of the impending catastrophe. The ship, a majestic ocean liner, was on a routine voyage from Quebec City to Liverpool. But as the night wore on, a thick, impenetrable fog descended, cloaking the river in a shroud of mystery and danger.

The Empress of Ireland was not alone in the fog. The Norwegian collier SS Storstad was also navigating the treacherous waters, its crew straining to see through the murky veil. At 1:55 a.m., disaster struck. Both ships saw each other briefly before the collision but misjudged maneuvers due to confusion over signals. The Storstad's bow sliced into the side of the Empress of Ireland with a sickening crunch.

Water poured into the gaping wound, and the ship took 14 minutes to sink, succumbing to the severe damage and poor watertight compartment design. Panic ensued as passengers and crew scrambled for lifeboats. The icy waters claimed 1,012 lives (840 passengers and 172 crew) out of 1,477 people on board, meaning 465 survived, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in Canadian history.

The tragedy was overshadowed by the looming specter of World War I, but it was widely reported at the time and remains Canada’s worst peacetime maritime tragedy. The sinking of the RMS Empress of Ireland in the St. Lawrence River near Rimouski, Quebec, serves as a haunting reminder of the perils of maritime travel and the unforgiving nature of the sea. It stands as a testament to the bravery of those who fought to save lives amidst chaos and despair.
