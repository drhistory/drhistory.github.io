The Wars of the Roses had torn England apart, a dynastic struggle between the houses of York and Lancaster. By 1461, the conflict had reached a fever pitch. Edward, who had been proclaimed King Edward IV on March 4, 1461, had recently claimed the throne, but his hold on power was tenuous. The Lancastrians, loyal to the deposed King Henry VI, were determined to reclaim the crown.

The Battle of Towton was not just a fight for the throne; it was a fight for survival. Both sides knew that defeat could mean annihilation. As the armies met, a fierce snowstorm swept across the battlefield, blinding the soldiers and adding to the chaos. The Yorkists, led by Edward IV, were said to have used the wind to their advantage, launching arrows that cut through the Lancastrian ranks, although this tactical advantage remains speculative.

The turning point came when the Lancastrian forces, overwhelmed and outmaneuvered, began to falter. Edward's leadership and the strategic use of archers turned the tide. By the end of the day, the Lancastrians were in full retreat, leaving behind a field littered with the dead and dying. It was a decisive victory for the Yorkists, solidifying Edward IV's claim to the throne and altering the course of English history.

The Battle of Towton remains a stark reminder of the brutal nature of civil war, a conflict where brother fought against brother, and the fate of a nation hung in the balance.
