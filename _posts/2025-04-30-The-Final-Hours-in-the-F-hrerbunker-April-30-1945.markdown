## Story
Deep beneath the war-torn streets of Berlin, the air was thick with despair and the acrid smell of gunpowder. The once-mighty Third Reich was crumbling, and in the heart of the Führerbunker, Adolf Hitler faced the inevitable. As Soviet forces encircled the city, the man who had plunged the world into chaos was preparing for his final act.

The situation was dire. Berlin was a city under siege, with Soviet artillery pounding relentlessly. Inside the bunker, a sense of doom pervaded. Hitler, once the charismatic leader of a nation, was now a shadow of his former self—paranoid, isolated, and defeated.

In the early afternoon of April 30, 1945, Hitler retreated to his private quarters with Eva Braun, whom he had married in a hastily arranged ceremony the day before. The couple bid farewell to their closest confidants, knowing the end was near. Moments later, Hitler was dead by his own hand, a bullet to the head, while Eva Braun died by cyanide poisoning.

The death of Adolf Hitler was a decisive moment that signaled the imminent conclusion of World War II in Europe, though the formal surrender of Nazi Germany did not occur until May 7–8, 1945 (VE Day). Yet, the legacy of his actions would haunt the world for generations to come.
