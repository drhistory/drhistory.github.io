## Story

As the first light of dawn broke over the desert sands of Iraq, a profound silence fell across the battlefield. The roar of tanks and the thunder of artillery had ceased, replaced by the quiet murmur of soldiers daring to hope. It was February 28, 1991, and the Gulf War had reached a planned conclusion.

The conflict had begun months earlier, when Iraqi forces, under the command of Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait, igniting a swift and fierce response from a coalition led by the United States. The world watched as Operation Desert Storm unfolded, a high-tech blitzkrieg that showcased the might of modern warfare.

For weeks, coalition forces had pounded Iraqi positions from the air, followed by a ground assault known as Operation Desert Sabre, which began on February 24, 1991, and lasted only 100 hours. The liberation of Kuwait was swift, but the path to peace was fraught with uncertainty.

The turning point came when U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared a ceasefire, signaling a temporary halt to hostilities. The decision was met with relief and skepticism. While the immediate threat had been neutralized, the region remained a tinderbox of unresolved tensions. This ceasefire led to a more formal agreement on March 3, 1991, and the official end of the war with the signing of the formal ceasefire agreement on April 11, 1991.

As the dust settled, the world was left to ponder the cost of war and the fragile nature of peace. The Gulf War had ended, but its echoes would reverberate for years to come, shaping the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East.
