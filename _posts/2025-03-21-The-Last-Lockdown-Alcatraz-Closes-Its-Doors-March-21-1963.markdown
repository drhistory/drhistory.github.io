## Story

The clang of the final cell door echoed through the cold, damp corridors of Alcatraz, marking the end of an era. On March 21, 1963, the infamous island prison, once home to America’s most notorious criminals, closed its doors for good. The last of the inmates were ferried away, leaving behind a silent fortress in the middle of San Francisco Bay.

For nearly three decades, Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary stood as a symbol of maximum security and inescapable confinement. Its isolated location, surrounded by frigid waters and strong currents, made it the perfect place to house notorious criminals. Al Capone and 'Machine Gun' Kelly were among its most famous inmates, though neither was present at the time of the prison's closure. Capone was transferred to Alcatraz in 1934 and released in 1939, while Kelly was transferred there in 1934 and moved to Leavenworth in 1951.

Yet, despite its fearsome reputation, the prison was plagued by high operational costs and crumbling infrastructure. The decision to close Alcatraz was not made lightly. The cost of maintaining the aging facility was astronomical, and the harsh conditions took a toll on both inmates and staff. The prison's closure marked the end of a chapter in American penal history, as the government sought more modern and humane solutions to incarceration.

As the last boat pulled away from the island, Alcatraz was left to the seagulls and the whispers of its storied past. The once-bustling prison became a relic, a haunting reminder of a bygone era.

Today, Alcatraz stands as a popular tourist destination, drawing visitors from around the world eager to walk the same halls as its infamous former residents. But as you stand on the island, gazing across the bay, you can't help but wonder about the lives that were forever changed within its walls.
