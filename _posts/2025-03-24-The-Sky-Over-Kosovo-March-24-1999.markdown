## Story

The night sky over Kosovo was suddenly ablaze with the fiery trails of missiles and the roar of jet engines. It was March 24, 1999, and NATO had launched a significant military operation against a sovereign state without explicit UN approval. The target: the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The mission: to stop the ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo.

The Kosovo War had been raging for months, with reports of atrocities and mass displacement flooding the international community. Diplomatic efforts had failed, and the world watched as the situation deteriorated. NATO, led by the United States, decided to act, believing that air power could force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević to halt his campaign of terror.

The initial strikes were precise, targeting military installations and infrastructure. But as the campaign dragged on, the bombing expanded, hitting bridges, factories, and even the Chinese embassy in Belgrade—a mistake officially attributed to outdated maps, which nearly escalated the conflict further. The skies over Yugoslavia became a theater of destruction, with NATO aircraft flying thousands of sorties.

The turning point came as the relentless bombing campaign, combined with diplomatic pressure, forced Milošević to capitulate. On June 10, 1999, Yugoslav forces began withdrawing from Kosovo, and a UN administration was established, bringing a fragile peace to the war-torn region.

The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia remains a controversial chapter in modern history, raising questions about the use of force, sovereignty, and the responsibility to protect human rights.
