For years, Tunisia had been under the yoke of French colonialism, its people yearning for self-determination. The struggle for independence was long and arduous, led by the charismatic and determined Habib Bourguiba. His vision for a free Tunisia inspired a nation, uniting people from all walks of life in a common cause.

The turning point came in the early 1950s, as the winds of change swept across North Africa. Bourguiba's diplomatic efforts and the relentless pressure from the Tunisian people forced France to reconsider its position. Negotiations were tense, but on that fateful day in March, the world witnessed the birth of a new nation.

As the sun set on March 20, 1956, Tunisia stood proud and independent. Bourguiba, hailed as the father of the nation, took the helm as its first Prime Minister, steering Tunisia towards a future of hope and possibility. The road ahead was uncertain, but the spirit of independence burned brightly in the hearts of its people.
